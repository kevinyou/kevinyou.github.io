Hi Jeffrey,

 

We understand you’re seeking an internship soon and we’d like to invite you in for a formal interview based on our meeting with you a few weeks ago at UT.

 

If you’re still interested and available can you please let me know what your availability looks like next Thursday & Friday (i.e. morning vs afternoon)?

 

We look forward to hearing back from you soon.

 

Many thanks!
